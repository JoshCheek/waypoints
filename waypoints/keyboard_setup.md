Keyboard Setup
==============

In a good environment, thinking means doing.


Type faster and reclaim capslock!
---------------------------------

Open the Keyboard preferences:

* Click the "ï£¿" (upper left of screen)
* Choose "System Preferences"
* Keyboard

Make these changes:

1. Set "Key Repeat" to the fastest option.
1. Turn "Delay Until Repeat" to the shortest option
1. Within "Modifier Keys", change "Caps Lock" to "Control"

BUT, JOSH, I *USE* CAPSLOCK, LET THIS STATEMENT BE EVIDENCE.
------------------------------------------------------------

To use your computer well, you need to press control
probably thousands of times a day, lets optimize
for that use case instead of for yelling at people on the internet.
Also, I just typed that header by placing my right pinky on shift.
And every text editor has some way to change the case of chunks of text.
For example, in Atom you can do `Edit -> Text -> Upper Case`.
In vim, you highlight the text (aka "visual mode") and press "U"

Josh, Typing isn't my bottleneck, thinking/planning/understanding is
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you can type quickly and precisely, when you know your tools,
the computer melts away and just does what you're thinking.
Once you achieve this, thinking and doing become synonymous.
The process of thinking should be heavily interactive.
As you think it, it happens and you get feedback you can use to
amend the thought.
If not, then you're relying on your memory to keep track of the state
of your thoughts.
This is a dramatically inferior form of feedback than doing the thing:
your brain is having to play computer, and it's not evolved for that task.

Another way to think about it: When you write a letter, you don't compose
the whole thing in your head and then type it after the fact, thinking
and writing occur in tandem.
