# Build sleep

[Example video](FIXME) (have a student create this)

Sleep is a program that receives a number.
That number tells it how many seconds to sleep for.

Ruby has a method, `sleep`, that you can call, as well.

1. Run the sleep command `$ sleep 2`
1. Write your own sleep that works the same way: `$ ruby sleep.rb 2`
