# Build touch

[Example video](FIXME) (have a student create this)

Touch is a program that receives a filename as an argument,
and will make a new, empty file, if it doesn't exist.
But won't do anything, if it already exists.

Create your own touch program:

1. Make a file with something in it.
1. Touch it and another file.
1. See that the other file got made, and the first file is the same as before.
1. Write your own Ruby version: `$ ruby touch.rb file1 file2`
